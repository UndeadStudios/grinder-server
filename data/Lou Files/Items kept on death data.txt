* New interface required
* Attributable items support
* Untradeable items support
* Broken items support
* Support for changing item id on death, then checking it as normal item for the new version of the item (upon death, if it is counted to drop)
* Degradeable items support (all degradeables should not be tradeable, and on drop it should reset your count for the item, and support multiple items)
